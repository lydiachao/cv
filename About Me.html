    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="overview">I have had the opportunity to work in various industries over the past decade,
            including academic research institutions, international technology organizations,
            not-for-profit as well as for-profit government organizations, in both unionized
            and non-unionized environments. <br><br>
            Over the past 7 years, I have coordinated various HR operations, including
            recruitment, employee and labour relations, compensation and benefits, reporting,
            new system roll-outs, and leave administration. My desire and passion to cultivate
            meaningful and trusting working relationships enabled me to become a trusted first
            point of contact for many employees and leaders, especially with teammates
            at our satellite offices across the country. <br><br>
            Over the last 3 years, I continued my personal development in
            communication and leadership skills through the Toastmasters education
            program, where I was given numerous chances to lead different
            leadership teams as well as conduct various training sessions within
            the Lower Mainland. In recent months, I have immersed myself in learning how to do
            more interesting data analyses using the Python programming language, as well as
            learn how to create beautiful and functional mobile applications with Flutter,
            using the Dart programming language. <br><br>
            I would be more than happy to chat with you to see how we can work together
            to further leverage and enhance your teams' untapped potentials.
